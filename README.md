SQL-Powered Insights: Finance & Supply Chain Analytics at Atliq Hardware

AtliQ Hardware faced challenges in managing large datasets with Excel, affecting efficiency and decision-making. To overcome this, we leveraged SQL to streamline data processing, analyze sales trends, and optimize inventory management. This project transformed raw data into actionable insights, enabling smarter, data-driven strategies for growth.

🔍 Key Analysis Conducted:

📌 Monthly Gross Sales Report – A stored procedure was designed to retrieve monthly gross sales for any customer, ensuring better financial tracking.

📌 Fiscal Year Calculation – A SQL function, get_fiscal_year(), was implemented to dynamically determine the fiscal year from any given date.

📌 Comprehensive Sales View – A SQL view was created, consolidating critical data points such as date, fiscal year, customer details, product performance, and revenue insights to streamline reporting.

📌 Top Products by Net Sales – A stored procedure was developed to fetch the top N performing products (excluding variants) for a given fiscal year, supporting data-driven inventory decisions.

📌 Market Performance Analysis – The top 2 markets in every region were identified based on gross sales for FY 2021, providing insights into the most profitable regions.

By leveraging SQL’s stored procedures, views, and functions, this project effectively streamlined financial and supply chain analytics.

📊 SQL continues to be a powerful tool for data analysis, enabling businesses to make informed, strategic decisions!
